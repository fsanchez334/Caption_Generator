# COMS W4705 - Homework 5 
## Image Captioning with Conditioned LSTM Generators
Daniel Bauer <bauer@cs.columbia.edu>

Follow the instructions in this notebook step-by step. Much of the code is provided, but some sections are marked with **todo**. 

Specifically, you will build the following components: 

* Create matrices of image representations using an off-the-shelf image encoder.
* Read and preprocess the image captions. 
* Write a generator function that returns one training instance (input/output sequence pair) at a time. 
* Train an LSTM language generator on the caption data.
* Write a decoder function for the language generator. 
* Add the image input to write an LSTM caption generator. 
* Implement beam search for the image caption generator.

Please see the special submission instructions at the bottom.

"""Note that we do not need an UNK word token because we are generating. The generated text will only contain tokens seen at training time.

## Part III Basic Decoder Model (24 pts)

For now, we will just train a model for text generation without conditioning the generator on the image input. 

There are different ways to do this and our approach will be slightly different from the generator discussed in class.

The core idea here is that the Keras recurrent layers (including LSTM) create an "unrolled" RNN. Each time-step is represented as a different unit, but the weights for these units are shared. We are going to use the constant MAX_LEN to refer to the maximum length of a sequence, which turns out to be 40 words in this data set (including START and END).
"""

max(len(description) for image_id in train_list for description in descriptions[image_id])

"""In class, we discussed LSTM generators as transducers that map each word in the input sequence to the next word. 
<img src="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~bauer/4705/lstm1.png" width="480px">

Instead, we will use the model to predict one word at a time, given a partial sequence. For example, given the sequence ["START","a"], the model might predict "dog" as the most likely word. We are basically using the LSTM to encode the input sequence up to this point. 
<img src="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~bauer/4705/lstm2.png" width="480px">

To train the model, we will convert each description into a set of input output pairs as follows. For example, consider the sequence 

`['<START>', 'a', 'black', 'dog', '.', '<END>']`

We would train the model using the following input/output pairs 

| i | input                        | output |
|---|------------------------------|--------|
| 0 |[`START`]                     | `a`    |  
| 1 |[`START`,`a`]                 | `black`|
| 2 |[`START`,`a`, `black`]        | `dog`  |
| 3 |[`START`,`a`, `black`, `dog`] | `END`  |

Here is the model in Keras Keras. Note that we are using a Bidirectional LSTM, which encodes the sequence from both directions and then predicts the output. 
Also note the `return_sequence=False` parameter, which causes the LSTM to return a single output instead of one output per state. 

Note also that we use an embedding layer for the input words. The weights are shared between all units of the unrolled LSTM. We will train these embeddings with the model.

"""The model input is a numpy ndarray (a tensor) of size `(batch_size, MAX_LEN)`. Each row is a vector of size MAX_LEN in which each entry is an integer representing a word (according to the `word_to_id` dictionary). If the input sequence is shorter than MAX_LEN, the remaining entries should be padded with 0. 

For each input example, the model returns a softmax activated vector (a probability distribution) over possible output words. The model output is a numpy ndarray of size `(batch_size, vocab_size)`. vocab_size is the number of vocabulary words.

### Creating a Generator for the Training Data

**TODO**: 

We could simply create one large numpy ndarray for all the training data. Because we have a lot of training instances (each training sentence will produce up to MAX_LEN input/output pairs, one for each word), it is better to produce the training examples *lazily*, i.e. in batches using a generator (recall the image generator in part I). 

Write the function `text_training_generator` below, that takes as a paramater the batch_size and returns an `(input, output)` pair. `input` is a `(batch_size, MAX_LEN)` ndarray of partial input sequences, `output` contains the next words predicted for each partial input sequence, encoded as a `(batch_size, vocab_size)` ndarray.

Each time the next() function is called on the generator instance, it should return a new batch of the *training* data. You can use `train_list` as a list of training images. A batch may contain input/output examples extracted from different descriptions or even from different images. 

You can just refer back to the variables you have defined above, including `descriptions`, `train_list`, `vocab_size`, etc.

Hint: To prevent issues with having to reset the generator for each epoch and to make sure the generator can always return exactly `batch_size` input/output pairs in each step, wrap your code into a `while True:` loop. This way, when you reach the end of the training data, you will just continue adding training data from the beginning into the batch.

## Part IV - Beam Search Decoder (24 pts)

**TODO** Modify the simple greedy decoder for the caption generator to use beam search. 
Instead of always selecting the most probable word, use a *beam*, which contains the n highest-scoring sequences so far and their total probability (i.e. the product of all word probabilities). I recommend that you use a list of `(probability, sequence)` tuples. After each time-step, prune the list to include only the n most probable sequences. 

Then, for each sequence, compute the n most likely successor words. Append the word to produce n new sequences and compute their score. This way, you create a new list of n*n candidates. 

Prune this list to the best n as before and continue until `MAX_LEN` words have been generated. 

Note that you cannot use the occurence of the `"<END>"` tag to terminate generation, because the tag may occur in different positions for different entries in the beam. 

Once `MAX_LEN` has been reached, return the most likely sequence out of the current n.
